                Back in the day, there was just Java edition. Now, there are so many that even I
                can barely keep track of them. Luckily I have this helpful little guide written to help
                you. First things first, I will only be listing the main game, and not any of the spin-offs
                like legends or dungeons because neither of them are the typical sandbox game that
                you might expect, and they frankly deserve their own articles.
            </p>
            <h3>Legacy console editions</h3>

            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                The first set of versions that I'm going to mention are the legacy console editions. This
                harkens back to the early days of Minecraft, back in the early 2010's. This predominantly 
                includes both the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game, although there were also PS Vita 
                and Wii U versions. They are unfortunately abandoned now, but are probably 
                still good for a bit of fun if you happen to dust off your old Xbox.
                Either way though, most people will not be playing on this version, so lets move on.
            </p>
            <h3>Java edition</h3>
            <p>
                Next version is Java edition. This version in my opinion is for two different groups of
                people: Mac users and modders. Unfortunately, Java edition is the only option for Mac users,
                due to Java itself being cross-platform by design. Luckily the percentage of Minecraft players
                on Mac is pretty small, and they seem to be doing just fine.
            </p>

            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                Java edition is also your only real option if you plan to mod the game. Other editions benefit
                from texture packs and behavior packs, but good luck if you want to

                    go to the freaking moon!
                </a>
                That being said, I am not sure I can recommend it for all PC users (especially low end hardware)
                due to the severe optimization issues that it has accumulated over the years.
            </p>
            <h3>Bedrock Edition</h3>
            <p>
                The next one is what I would recommend that most people play on, which is Bedrock edition. This
                edition is what is available for all major mobile platforms, Windows, Xbox one/series consoles, 
                PS4/PS5 and the Nintendo Switch. Written in C++ rather than Java, Bedrock editions of Minecraft 
                are much more optimized for the devices that they run on. The downside is that the game is much 
                less customizable than Java edition, and console users are required to pay for premium online 
                services, but it's not like they have a choice anyways. Nevertheless, it's the version that runs 
                on the most platforms, simple to play, and is perfectly optimized. For that reason, I recommend 
                it for the most people.

            <p>
                Resource packs have been a staple of Minecraft for many years. One slightly less known method of changing Minecraft's look is using shader packs. 
                These shader packs require you to mod your installation, but in return you can alter the visual appearance much more. Instead of changing block
                texture, shader packs generally alter lighting, shadows, clouds, and water effects. So without further ado then, lets go over what shaders and
                resource packs that we use here at Minepaper.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>1. Bliss</h3>
            <p>
                The Bliss shader pack is one that gives Minecraft a very pastel appearance. Colors are bright and vibrant, but my favorite part are the
                hyperrealistic clouds.
            </p>
            <img src="https://cdn.minepaper.net/2023-08-05_13.20.30.png" class="col-md-6" style="width: 50%; object-fit: contain;"/>

            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>2. BSL</h3>
            <p>
                BSL shaders take on a very similar appearance to Bliss in my opinion. The biggest difference to me is the slight aura that appears around blocks
                when the light level is high. Clouds also look much softer than in Bliss, and there is a diamond shaped sun and moon. Shadows and water effects 
                look pretty much the same though.
            </p>

            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>3. ComplementaryReimagined</h3>
            <p>
                This is another shader pack that gives Minecraft a distinct pastel appearance. Unlike in Bliss or BSL however, colors are a tad bit darker. In
                addition, clouds have a funky rounded appearance that makes this pack unique. Lastly, the pastel appearance also appplies to bodies of water
                in this one.
            </p>

            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>4. ProjectLUMA</h3>
            <p>
                ProjectLUMA breaks the pastel trend of the previous items in the list and aims for raw visual fidelity. The colors are highly saturated, 
                shadows are sharp, water looks like it came from a clear mountain stream, and the clouds are ultra realistic. Highly recommended.
            </p>

            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>5. Solas Shaders</h3>
            <p>
                This shader pack is the one that I personally find to be the most beautiful. This is mostly owing to the amazing display of stars you will
                see above the clouds even in the daytime. In addition, there is a breathtaking view of the aurora borealis at night that will leave your
                jaws wide open like a barn door. These two factors alone are enough to trick you into thinking you're in a fantasy land, but it doesn't
                end there. The shadows and water effects are perfectly akin to real life, and there is a circular sun and moon to boot. Overall, this is a
                shader pack that is just waiting to wow you, and you should give it a shot if you are looking to spruce up your experience.

            <br />
            <h3>6. Patrix</h3>
            <p>
                Moving on to resource packs now, we have Patrix. I personally adore Patrix due to the rustic look that it brings to Minecraft. Cobblestone,
                Wood, and Dirt make npc villages look like they come from 16th century Europe. I also enjoy the look of ice blocks in particular, with their
                webbed appearance that makes it look there are air bubbles trapped amongst the frozen blocks.
            </p>
            <img src="https://cdn.minepaper.net/2023-08-05_13.53.08.png" class="col-md-6" style="width: 50%; object-fit: contain;"/>

            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>7. ModernArch</h3>
            <p>
                Last but certainly not least, we have ModernArch. This is a resource pack that I find make the look of NPC villages very pleasing in
                particular. Wooden doors have a sleek and modern appearance. Wood and Cobblestone blocks also look very clean, and torches look like old
                school gas lanterns. Overall, I highly recommend this pack if your goal is to spruce up the look of artificial structures in game.

                Minepaper is a desktop application that will run in the background on your computer. All of the wallpapers are stored in the cloud,
                and will get downloaded onto your computer automatically. Then, you simply just flip the switch, and set the interval that you want the
                wallpaper to change at. After that, you can simply forget about it! Minepaper will run silently in the background, and your wallpaper
                will be consistently refreshed with no action from you necessary. This app is completely free and open source, and is available for
                both Windows and MacOS. Enjoy!
